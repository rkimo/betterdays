            <p>
              A concurrent disorder is when a substance problem and a mental health problem both occur in the same
              person at the same time. Self-medication of mental health problems with substances is common and can
              lead to problematic substance use (addiction). </p>

            <p> All patients will be screened for underlying mental health disorders. If a diagnosis is made,
              treatment with counselling and/or medications will be offered. Most people have better outcomes when
              one doctor treats both the substance and the mental health problem together rather than multiple
              doctors with separate treatments.</p>

            <p> Common co-occurring mental health problems may include depression, anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, ADHD, and
              psychosis.</p>
