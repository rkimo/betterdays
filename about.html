          <div class="text-justify">

              difficult to seek help, but whenever you’re ready, we’re here to support your recovery journey with
              compassion and respect.</p>

            <p>We offer evidence-based, patient-centered care for all substances and any related mental health
              challenges. Effective treatment often combines counseling and medication, and many people do recover
              from substance use disorders.</p>

            <p>Our focus is on in-person care to build stronger therapeutic connections, but telehealth options are
              also available in selective circumstances.</p>

            <p>Most people self-refer. Call or email to book an assessment. We’re also happy to work with your
              family physician if you have one.</p>
